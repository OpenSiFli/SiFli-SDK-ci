## Preparation

### Hardware

- A development board, such as [SF32LB52-DevKit-LCD Development Board][52DevKit]

- Computer (Windows, Linux, or macOS)

### Software

To use SiFli-SDK on SF32, please install the following software:
- Set up toolchain for compiling SF32 code;
- Build tool â€” SDK2.x uses Scons as the build tool for compiling SF32 applications;
- Obtain SiFli-SDK software development framework. This framework basically includes SF32 APIs (software libraries and source code) and scripts for running the **toolchain**;

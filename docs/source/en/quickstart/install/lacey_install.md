# Installing Environment Using ENV Tool

Compared to full script-based environment installation, you might prefer or be more familiar with using the previous SiFli-ENV tool to install and manage the SiFli-SDK development environment. While we recommend using script installation, SiFli-ENV can still be used for compatibility. However, please note that SiFli-ENV may be deprecated in future versions.

## Download SiFli-ENV Tool

The current latest download link for the SiFli-ENV tool is: <https://downloads.sifli.com/sdk/env_1.1.2.zip>.

If you encounter the prompt `Please upgrade env to v1.1.2 or greater`, it indicates that your ENV version is outdated. Please use the above link to download the latest version of the SiFli-ENV tool.

After downloading, extract the files to the directory where you wish to store SiFli-ENV. Double-click the `env.bat` file to open the command line window.

# Data Service

Applications need to use data from various sensors or data transmitted via BLE, and this data may come from different hardware interfaces or cores. For example, sensors connected to the LCPU may provide data, and the graphical interface running on the HCPU may need to display the data collected by the sensor. To simplify dual-core designs and to make the application unaware of the data sources, regardless of which core generates the data or from which device, data consumers can obtain and process the data in the same way. The SDK provides a data service framework that allows applications to use the data without knowing the details of data generation.

The main features include:
- Applications can subscribe to data services, where the application is called the subscriber or client, acting as the consumer of the data.
- Sensor or BLE data services act as the provider, implementing a specific data service and obtaining data from I2C, SPI, or different remote BLE devices. They are the producers of the data.
- The framework supports data service providers and subscribers running on different CPU cores. A data service can be implemented on one core and moved to another core without affecting the subscriber application.
- Provides data service simulation features to allow independent development of applications and data services.
- Thread-safe API interfaces, allowing the service to be used in multi-threaded environments.

The SIFLI SDK includes test tools for testing data service providers or subscribers. Users can simulate sensor services, such as heart rate sensors, compass, motion sensors, etc. These functions are integrated with the SDK example â€“ the watch emulator, which helps users develop watch applications that require sensor support. For a detailed introduction to the data service API, please refer to [data_service](middleware-data_service).

Data is transferred between cores/threads via messages, which are divided into request (XXX_REQ) and response (XXX_RSP) types. A request message is sent from the client to the service, while a response message is sent from the service to the client. The message ID is 16 bits long, with the lower 15 bits representing the message number, and the highest bit (bit 15) indicating the message type: 0 for request messages and 1 for response messages. Request and response messages typically appear in pairs, with the lower 15 bits of their IDs being the same, and only the highest bit differing. For example, the following defines two messages, `SUBSCRIBE_REQ` and `SUBSCRIBE_RSP`:

```c
MSG_SERVICE_SUBSCRIBE_REQ = 0x0,
MSG_SERVICE_SUBSCRIBE_RSP = RSP_MSG_TYPE | MSG_SERVICE_SUBSCRIBE_REQ,
```

Sometimes, a service may actively send messages to the client without a corresponding request message. In such cases, independent response messages are defined, generally ending with `IND`, but they are also marked as response messages. For example:

```c
MSG_SERVICE_DATA_NTF_IND  = RSP_MSG_TYPE | 0x09,
```

The framework reserves 48 message IDs (0x0 ~ 0x2F) for internal use. Users can define their own messages starting from `MSG_SERVICE_CUSTOM_ID_BEGIN` to avoid conflicts with the reserved messages. For example:

```c
typedef enum
{
    BLE_DFU_SEND_DATA_REQ = MSG_SERVICE_CUSTOM_ID_BEGIN,
    /* Response. */
    BLE_DFU_SEND_DATA_RSP = BLE_DFU_SEND_DATA_REQ | RSP_MSG_TYPE,
} ble_dfu_service_message_t;
```

## Data Service Configuration

Run `menuconfig`, and under `SiFli Middleware`, select `Enable Data Service`. If cross-core services are required, you must also select the `Enable IPC Queue Library` in the Middleware. Once configured, the following two macros will appear in the project's `rtconfig.h`:

- `BSP_USING_DATA_SVC`: A macro for enabling the data service.
- `USING_IPC_QUEUE`: A macro for enabling IPC Queue to support cross-core operations.

```c
#define BSP_USING_DATA_SVC 1
#define USING_IPC_QUEUE 1
```

## System Resources Used

If IPC Queue is enabled, the data service framework uses IPC Queue 1 as the communication channel between the two cores. The buffer address for sending from HCPU to LCPU is `HCPU2LCPU_MB_CH2_BUF_START_ADDR`, with a size of `HCPU2LCPU_MB_CH2_BUF_SIZE`. The buffer address for sending from LCPU to HCPU is `LCPU2HCPU_MB_CH2_BUF_START_ADDR`, with a size of `LCPU2HCPU_MB_CH2_BUF_SIZE`. The default size for these buffers is 512 bytes. If you need to change the buffer size, refer to (_/app_note/memory_usage.md_).

## Registering Data Services

The data service component is an open framework, and the implemented data services must be registered with the framework before they can be used by subscribers. The following example uses the function `#datas_register` to register a service named `test`. Note that service registration must be done during the `INIT_COMPONENT` stage to ensure all services are ready when the data service framework is started during the `INIT_ENV` phase.

```c
#include "data_service_provider.h"

bool test_service_filter(data_req_t *config, uint16_t msg_id, uint32_t len, uint8_t *data)		
{
    return TRUE;								// Do not filter any data, push all data to subscriber.
}

static void timer_callback()
{
    datas_ind_size(service, 16);				// Indicate to service that 16 bytes of data is generated
}

static int32_t test_service_msg_handler(datas_handle_t service, data_msg_t *msg)
{
    switch (msg->msg_id)
    {
        case MSG_SERVICE_SUBSCRIBE_REQ:
            // Start to generate data, for example, start a periodical timer to read from sensor. Timeout will call timer_callback.
            break;
        case MSG_SERVICE_UNSUBSCRIBE_REQ:
            // Stop generating data, for example, stop the periodical timer created earlier.
            break;
        case MSG_SERVICE_CONFIG_REQ:
        case MSG_SERVICE_TX_REQ:
        case MSG_SERVICE_RX_REQ:
            break;
        case MSG_SERVICE_DATA_RDY_IND:
        {
            data_rdy_ind_t *data_ind = (data_rdy_ind_t *)(data_service_get_msg_body(msg));
            uint8_t *data;

            // Fetch data, the code is not in this sample. In this example, data_ind->len is 16 bytes.
            ...
            datas_push_data_to_client(service, data_ind->len, data);
            break;
        }
        default:
            ASSERT(0);			// Unknown message
    }
    return 0;
}

static data_service_config_t test_service=
{
    .max_client_num = 5,						// Support up to 5 client connections
    .queue = NULL,								// Use framework thread for message handling
    .data_filter = test_service_filter,			// Message filter
    .msg_handler = test_service_msg_handler,	// Message handler
};

static int test_service_register(void)
{
    /* Register test service, service name is "test" */
    datas_handle_t service_handle = datas_register("test", &test_service);
    RT_ASSERT(service_handle);

    return 0;
}
INIT_COMPONENT_EXPORT(test_service_register);
```

## Using Data Services

Applications use the service name to subscribe to services. The following example shows how to subscribe to a service named `test` and send a request message. Note that you can only send a message to the service after successfully subscribing. Otherwise, it will return a failure.

```c
#include "data_service_subscriber.h"

int datasvc_clnt_callback(data_callback_arg_t *arg)
{
    if (MSG_SERVICE_TEST_DATA_REQ == arg->msg_id)
    {
        uint8_t *data = arg->data;
        // Handle arg->data, length is indicated by arg->data_len
        LOG("Command result %d
", rsp->result);
    }
    else if (MSG_SERVICE_DATA_NTF_IND == arg->msg_id)
    {
        LOG("Get data length %d
", arg->data_len);
    }
    else
    {
        LOG("Get message %d
", arg->msg_id);
    }
}

static datac_handle_t hdl;

int main(void)
{
    // Allocate subscriber (i.e., client) handle
    hdl = datac_open();
    // Check handle
    RT_ASSERT(DATA_CLIENT_INVALID_HANDLE != hdl);

    // Subscribe to a service named "test"
    hdl = datac_subscribe(hdl, "test", datasvc_clnt_callback, NULL);
}

int send_req(void)
{
    data_msg_t msg;
    uint8_t *body;
    rt_err_t err;

    body = data_service_init_msg(&msg, MSG_SERVICE_TEST_DATA_REQ, 0);
    err = datac_send_msg(client_handle, &msg);
    RT_ASSERT(RT_EOK == err);
}

int unsubscribe(void)
{
    // Unsubscribe from data service. hdl could be used to subscribe again
    datac_unsubscribe(hdl);

    // Free subscriber handle, the handle cannot be used anymore
    datac_close(hdl);
    hdl = DATA_CLIENT_INVALID_HANDLE;
}
```

## Call Sequence

Users should follow the following call sequence to use data services. In the SDK, the data service framework is started during the `INIT_ENV` phase, so it requires the data service to be registered in the `INIT_COMPONENT` phase. Subscribers can only subscribe to services in the `INIT_APP` phase or later.

1. `datas_register`: Called during the `INIT_COMPONENT` phase of RT-Thread to register the data service with the framework.
2. `datas_start`: Automatically executed during the `INIT_ENV` phase (no user code needed), starts the data service framework and accepts requests from subscribers. The HCPU will start the LCPU at this point.
3. `datac_open`: Allocates a port for the subscriber.
4. `datac_subscribe`: The subscriber initiates a connection and subscribes to the data service.

## Using Data Services in GUI

GUI systems like LVGL run in single-threaded mode and have their own LVGL task. To update data in the GUI thread, the data service defines specific interfaces that can be called from the GUI thread/task.

```c
```
